# fp-sie
A Free Pascal library to parse SIE files.

This is a Free Pascal implementation of [jsiSIE](https://github.com/idstam).

It still needs some quality control, but the *.pas files in src/ should be enough if you want to use SIE-files in your program.

project1.lpr in src/ has some code to read and write SIE-files.
